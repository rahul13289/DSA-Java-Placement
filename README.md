# LEETCODE IN JAVA

•	Understand the Problem: Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand all the requirements, constraints, and edge cases.

•	Brute Force First: If you're stuck, start with a brute force solution. It may not be the most efficient, but it can give you insights into the problem and help you come up with better solutions later.

•	Use Built-in Data Structures and Libraries: Java provides many built-in data structures and libraries that can simplify your code and improve its performance. Familiarize yourself with classes like ArrayList, HashMap, PriorityQueue, etc.

•	Choose the Right Data Structure: Choose the appropriate data structure based on the problem requirements. For example, use HashMap for fast lookups, ArrayList for dynamic arrays, PriorityQueue for priority-based operations, etc.

•	Optimize Time and Space Complexity: Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution. Try to optimize it if possible. Sometimes, trading off time complexity for space complexity or vice versa can lead to better solutions.

•	Handle Edge Cases: Make sure your solution handles all possible edge cases mentioned in the problem statement. This includes empty inputs, negative numbers, overflow conditions, etc.

•	Test Your Code: Write test cases to verify that your solution works correctly for different inputs and edge cases. LeetCode provides a platform for running your code against predefined test cases.

•	Use Recursion Wisely: If the problem can be solved recursively, consider using recursion. However, be mindful of stack overflow errors for large inputs. You may need to optimize your recursive solution using memoization or dynamic programming.

•	Modularize Your Code: Break down your solution into smaller, modular functions/methods. This makes your code more readable, maintainable, and easier to debug.

•	Read Others' Solutions: After you've solved a problem (or even if you're stuck), read others' solutions to learn different approaches and techniques. Understand why certain solutions are more efficient or elegant than others.

•	Practice, Practice, Practice: Like any skill, solving LeetCode problems requires practice. Make it a habit to solve a few problems regularly, even if it's just one problem per day. Over time, you'll become more proficient at problem-solving.
